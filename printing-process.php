        <p>For those with a technical interest, the aluminum printing process uses the science of sublimation, in which heat and pressure are applied to a solid, turning it into a gas through an endothermic reaction without passing through the liquid phase.  In sublimation printing, unique sublimation dyes are transferred to sheets of “transfer” paper via liquid gel ink through a piezoelectric print head.  After the digital design is printed onto sublimation transfer sheets, it is placed on a heat press along with the substrate to be sublimated.  Using a combination of time, temperature, and pressure, the image is transferred from the paper to the substrate.  The heat press applies this special combination, which sublimates (transfers) the dyes at the molecular level into the substrate, which in the case of my images, is a high definition, fade resistant ChromaLuxe® aluminum panel using the highest quality coating available in the industry. </p>

        <p>The most common dyes used for sublimation activate at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. However, a range of 380 to 420 degrees Fahrenheit is used for optimal color.  The end result of the sublimation process is a nearly permanent, high resolution, full color print. The dyes are infused into the substrate at the molecular level, rather than applied at the surface level (such as is the case with screen printing and direct to garment printing).  The prints will not crack, fade or peel from the aluminum sheet under normal conditions.  If the image becomes smudged or dusty, you can use a glass cleaner to wipe them clean, without the risk of harm to the image.</p>

        <p>Most metal print images are printed on high gloss aluminum panels. However, when an image will be displayed in a lighting location where it would be subject to glare, consideration should be given to use of panels that provide reduced or minimal glare options, such as mid-gloss, satin, sheer gloss, and sheer matte.</p>
