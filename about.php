				<p>My father, in the mid to late 1940s through the early 1950s, was a professional photographer.  By the time I was born, photography had become his avocation rather than his vocation.  Our garage became his home-built darkroom where he’d spend hours losing track of time working on processing his film, using enlargers, chemicals, and photographic paper.  I guess photography was a part of my genetic makeup, although I did not become serious about photography until well into the digital age.  Another trait I have in common with my father is that I too can lose all track of time once I get to processing photos, albeit I am doing it using a computer and software.   I definitely have it much easier than the film folks.  I have the utmost respect and admiration for those who use film and make magic happen the old way.</p>
				<p>I have called San Antonio TX home for the last twenty years. I grew up in El Paso TX and I became enamored with the State of New Mexico during my youth. I was attracted to New Mexico’s culture, architecture, and geography. I fully understand the allure of New Mexico that prompted Georgia O’Keeffe to travel there and make it her home. I travel fairly frequently to northern New Mexico and to me it is a photographic mecca.  Many of my photographic prints feature landscapes and unique architectural structures in New Mexico.  The San Antonio and Central Texas area also provides fertile ground for photography.</p>
				<p>The first time I saw a photograph printed on aluminum was during a trip I made to Santa Fe, NM in 2011. The print was a black and white image in which the grey portions of the image allowed the underlying aluminum to shine through. The image took on a different appearance as the light struck it from different angles. After returning to Texas, I started investigating the process of printing on aluminum, for both black and white and color images. Color images on aluminum also produce remarkable photographic prints. The colors are vivid and appear to jump out from the aluminum panel.</p>
				<p>The result of my exploration into using aluminum as a print medium is Alumages by Paul™. I print exclusively on aluminum.</p>
				<p>The prints are made using a dye-sublimation printing process to reproduce images onto aluminum panels. For a more technical explanation as to the process, click on the Printing Process link. In addition to the richness and beauty of the images, they are light weight, fade and scratch resistant, and they do not require framing.</p>
				<p>I hope you enjoy your visit to my website. If you are interested in purchasing a metal print of one of my images, or should you have any comments or questions, just click on the Contact link to get in touch with me. Alumages can be made in a variety of sizes, from as small as 8” x 10” all the way up to 48” x 96”. I’d be happy to review with you image sizes that are possible for individual images.</p>
				<p>Last, but not least, I need to throw out a few kudos. Thanks to my daughter for her design of my logo, to my son’s wife for providing me an outlet for my work using her web development skills, and to my wife, who has been my life partner for nearly 40 years and who exercises supreme patience when I don’t keep up with her pace during our nature hikes and sightseeing trips. When I have a camera in my hand, she knows that I am likely to be trailing behind.</p>
